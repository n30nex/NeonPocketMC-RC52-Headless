# RC52 Headless release flashing

> **RC52-L62 only—do not flash RCC6, RC32, T114, or RC52 variants with different radio hardware.**

These instructions are for the application-only UF2 attached to an official NeonPocketMC-RC52-Headless GitHub Release.

1. Confirm the connected device is the intended Heltec RC52 and record its stable USB identity.
2. Download the `.uf2` and `SHA256SUMS` files from the same GitHub Release.
3. Verify the UF2 against `SHA256SUMS` before copying it to the device.
4. Attach a suitable 868/915 MHz antenna before allowing LoRa transmission.
5. Enter the UF2 bootloader with the board’s reset sequence or a 1200-baud touch.
6. Confirm the mounted UF2 volume identifies an nRF52840 RC52 bootloader.
7. Copy only `firmware.uf2` to that volume.
8. Do not erase flash and do not write a bootloader, SoftDevice, or merged image.
9. After reboot, connect from the MeshCore phone app using the default PIN `123456`, then verify BLE reconnect and LoRa TX/RX before treating the flash as successful.

If BLE does not advertise, the device resets repeatedly, or USB identity changes unexpectedly, stop. Preserve the unit and capture its 115200-baud boot output instead of reflashing blindly.
